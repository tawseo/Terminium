# Terminium

A self-hosted, open-source alternative to Termius for SSH connection management.

## Features

- 🖥️ **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- 🔐 **Self-hosted**: Run your own Debian-based server
- 🔑 **Certificate Authentication**: Secure key-based authentication
- 📁 **ICMSF Files**: Import/Export encrypted connection profiles
- 💾 **Encrypted Storage**: Secure local credential storage
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean interface inspired by Termius
- 🔌 **SSH Management**: Full-featured SSH client with terminal emulation

## Architecture

### Server (Debian)
- OpenSSH server with enhanced security
- Connection management API
- Certificate authority for client authentication
- User management system

### Client (Cross-platform Desktop App)
- Built with Electron + React + TypeScript
- Terminal emulation with xterm.js
- SSH2 protocol support
- AES-256 encryption for local data
- ICMSF (Import Connection Mothership Server File) support

## Quick Start

### Server Setup (Debian/Ubuntu)
```bash
cd server
sudo ./setup.sh
```

### Client Installation

**From Release:**
Download the latest release for your platform from the releases page.

**From Source:**
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
npm run dist
```

## First-Time Setup

### Option 1: New Server Connection
1. Launch Terminium
2. Create username and password
3. Enter your server IP address
4. Follow the setup wizard to:
   - Install dependencies
   - Generate certificates
   - Configure authentication
   - Enable encryption

### Option 2: Import Existing Configuration
1. Launch Terminium
2. Select "Import Connection"
3. Choose your .icmsf file
4. Enter your credentials to decrypt

## ICMSF File Format

ICMSF (Import Connection Mothership Server File) is a military-grade encrypted file format containing:
- Server IP address
- Connection ports
- Authentication certificates
- User credentials (encrypted)

**File Extension:** `.icmsf`
**Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with enhanced security
**Key Derivation:** PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (600,000 iterations)
**Additional Security:** HMAC-SHA512 integrity verification, gzip compression
**Format:** Versioned binary format

See [ICMSF Security Specification](docs/ICMSF_SECURITY.md) for complete details.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- For server: Debian 11+ or Ubuntu 20.04+

### Build Client
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev        # Development mode
npm run build      # Production build
npm run dist       # Create distributable
```

### Run Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

## Security Features
